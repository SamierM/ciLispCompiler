Notes:

print should return the last s expression print( a b) should return the value of b

op1 and op2 are gone and we have a linked list of operands
if there are insufficient opperands submit an error and return 0
if there are too many opperands then just ignore the unnecessary operands


//part 6
implement add subtract mult print
can come back and add others later

//you were working on the eval functions
thinking about how to properly get the correct number of operands. 
need to print errors and warnings for too few and too many respectively

//KNOWN ERRORS
(mult 3) will correctly produce an error
if you do correct calculations and do a multiply later like (mult 2) it will return 4.000 for some reason



(add ((let (abcd 1)) (sub 3 abcd)) 4) 
(mult ((let (a 1) (b 2)) (add a b)) (sqrt 2)) 
(add ((let (a ((let (b 2)) (mult b (sqrt 10))))) (div a 2)) ((let (c 5)) (sqrt c))) 
((let (first (sub 5 1)) (second 2)) (add (pow 2 first) (sqrt second))) 
((let (real a ((let (real c 3) (integer d 4)) (mult c d)))) (sqrt a))
